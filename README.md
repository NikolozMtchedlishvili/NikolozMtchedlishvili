## Hi there 👋

Year-1 Dual Degree student (Business Administration + Computer Science & AI) at IE University.

I build backend-focused applications using Python, JavaScript, and APIs, with real-world projects in e-commerce payments, data-driven market analysis, and automated news platforms.

Currently seeking software engineering / backend / data internships where I can contribute to production-level systems.
